"""
Calculate the mass spectrum based on the NW (Nambu-Wheeler) model.

This script implements the NW model for calculating the theoretical mass spectrum
of particles based on geometric principles, comparing the results with observed
particle masses.

* Reads parameters from a YAML config (default: ./configs/default_nw_mass_spectrum.yml)
* Calculates theoretical mass values using the NW model equations
* Compares calculated masses with observed standard model particles
* Identifies potential resonances and mass relationships
* Outputs data files and visualizations in a timestamped directory

This script should implement:
1. NW model equations and parameters
2. Mass spectrum calculation functions
3. Comparison with standard model masses
4. Resonance identification algorithms
5. Visualization of mass spectrum patterns

# TODO: Implement full script with:
# - Imports (numpy, matplotlib, yaml, etc.)
# - NW model equations and calculation functions
# - Standard model mass comparison
# - Resonance pattern identification
# - Command line interface
# - Main execution logic
