"""
Calculate and visualize geodesics on Hopfion manifolds.

This script implements geodesic calculations on Hopfion manifolds with various
winding numbers and environmental pressure conditions, building on the
HopfionRelaxer framework.

* Reads parameters from a YAML config (default: ./configs/default_hopfion_geodesics.yml)
* Calculates stable Hopfion configurations using the anisotropic potential model
* Computes geodesic paths on the resulting manifolds
* Visualizes geodesic trajectories and energy distributions
* Outputs visualization and data files in a timestamped directory

This script should implement:
1. Integration with the HopfionRelaxer framework
2. Geodesic calculation on stabilized Hopfion manifolds
3. Support for different winding numbers and environmental pressure
4. Adaptive timestepping for numerical stability
5. Early exit logic for unstable configurations
6. Visualization of geodesic paths and energy distributions
