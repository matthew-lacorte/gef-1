"""
Find geometric intersections in 4D space for GEF configurations.

This script implements optimized algorithms for finding intersections between
geometric objects in 4D space, with applications to GEF theory.

* Reads parameters from a YAML config (default: ./configs/default_geometric_intersection.yml)
* Generates point clouds representing geometric objects in 4D space
* Uses KD-trees and vectorized operations for efficient intersection detection
* Outputs visualization of intersections and data files in a timestamped directory

This script should implement:
1. 4D geometric object generation
2. Efficient intersection detection algorithms using KD-trees
3. Visualization of intersections with dimension reduction techniques
4. Parallelized processing for large point clouds
5. Data export for further analysis
