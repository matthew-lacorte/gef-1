# Configuration for a GEF Mass Spectrum Sweep using the HopfionRelaxer Engine

# --- Experiment Metadata ---
particle_type: "LeptonFamily" # Human-readable name for this run series
output_dir: "data/sim_outputs/mass_spectrum/" # Base directory for results

# --- Physical Parameters of the GEF Lagrangian ---
# These define the "laws of physics" for this simulation run.
# They are direct inputs to the HopfionRelaxer.
mu_squared: 1.0          # (μ²) Sets the scale of symmetry breaking in the Mexican-hat potential.
lambda_val: 2.0          # (λ) The quartic self-coupling constant of the Φ-field.
P_env: 0.01              # (P_env) External environmental pressure, helps confine the soliton.
h_squared: 0.0           # (h²) Hook coupling. Set to 0 for single-particle stability tests.

# --- Resonance Model for the Internal Stabilizer (g²) ---
# This is the core of the "Generational Resonance" hypothesis.
# The effective g_squared is NOT a constant, but a function of N_w.
resonance_parameters:
  g_base_squared: 0.1    # A small, baseline stability factor for all N_w.
  
  # A list of resonance peaks. Each peak represents a potentially stable generation.
  peaks:
    - center: 1          # Centered on N_w = 1 (First Generation)
      amplitude: 5.0     # The strength of the stability resonance.
      sigma: 0.2         # The width of the resonance.
      
    - center: 207        # Hypothetical center for N_w ~ Muon/Electron mass ratio
      amplitude: 2.5     # A weaker resonance for the second generation.
      sigma: 5.0         # A broader resonance.
      
    - center: 3477       # Hypothetical center for N_w ~ Tau/Electron mass ratio
      amplitude: 1.0     # An even weaker resonance for the third generation.
      sigma: 20.0        # A very broad resonance.

# --- Simulation Grid & Solver Parameters ---
lattice_size: [32, 32, 32, 32] # (N0, N1, N2, N3) Grid size. Larger is more accurate but slower.
dx: 0.5                      # Grid spacing.

# Parameters controlling the numerical relaxation process
relaxation_dt: 1.0e-4        # Initial timestep for the solver.
max_iterations: 20000        # Maximum number of steps before giving up.
convergence_threshold: 1.0e-8 # Power dissipation threshold for declaring convergence.
early_exit_energy_threshold: 100.0 # If total energy explodes past this, assume unstable and stop.
friction: 0.95               # Friction term for the "heavy ball" solver.

# --- Experiment Sweep Configuration ---
# Defines the specific values of N_w to test.
