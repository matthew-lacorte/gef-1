"""
Generate geometric properties for standard model particle families.

This script calculates GEF properties for the standard model particles,
organizing them by family (leptons, quarks, bosons) and comparing their
geometric characteristics.

* Reads parameters from a YAML config (default: ./configs/default_standard_model_family.yml)
* Calculates geometric properties (frequency, tick time, radius) for each particle
* Groups results by particle family
* Generates comparative visualizations
* Outputs data files and plots in a timestamped directory

This script should implement:
1. Standard model particle definitions with accurate masses
2. Family classification and grouping
3. GEF geometric property calculations
4. Comparative visualization across families
5. Data export for further analysis

# TODO: Implement full script with:
# - Imports (numpy, matplotlib, yaml, etc.)
# - Standard model particle definitions
# - GEF property calculation functions
# - Family classification and visualization
# - Command line interface
# - Main execution logic
